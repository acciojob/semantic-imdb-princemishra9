<h1 >The Wolf of Wall Street</h1>
</header>
<section id="actor">, Jordan Belfort lands a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna. 
    He is quickly enticed into the drug-fueled stockbroker culture and Hanna's belief that a broker's only goal is to make money for himself. 
    Jordan loses his job following Black Monday, the largest one-day stock market drop in history, and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm
     on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Jordan makes a small fortune thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions.
    Jordan befriends his neighbor Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. 
    They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the "hard sell." Jordan's tactics and salesmanship
     largely contribute to the success of his pump and dump scheme, which involves inflating the price of a stock by issuing misleading, 
     positive statements in order to 
     sell it at an artificially augmented price.
      When the scheme's perpetrators sell their overvalued securities, 
     the price drops immensely, and those who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with stock that is suddenly worth much less than what they paid. To cloak this,
     Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name Stratton Oakmont in 1989.
     In 1998, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel (detained for an unrelated offense) has informed the FBI about Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming,
      Jordan agrees to gather
      evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency.
      Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their daughter and infant son.
      In a cocaine-fueled rage, Jordan hits Naomi and tries to drive away with his daughter but crashes his car in the driveway.

     Later, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie, warning him. The FBI discovers this, arrests Jordan, and raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite breaching his deal,
      Jordan receives a reduced sentence of 36 months in a minimum security prison for his testimony and is released in 2000 after serving 22 months. 
     After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales techniques.</section>
